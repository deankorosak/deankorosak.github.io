		<p> Residing in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, beta cells contribute to glucose homeostasis by managing the body's insulin supply. Although it has been acknowledged that healthy $\beta$-cells engage in heavy cell-to-cell communication to perform their homeostatic function, the exact role and effects of such communication remain partly understood. We offer a novel perspective on the subject in the form of (i) a dynamical network model that faithfully mimics fast calcium oscillations in response to above-threshold glucose stimulation and (ii) empirical data analysis that reveals a qualitative shift in the cross-correlation structure of measured signals below and above the threshold glucose concentration. Combined together, these results point to a glucose-induced transition in beta-cell activity thanks to increasing coordination through gap-junctional signaling and paracrine interactions. Our data and the model further suggest how the conservation of entire cell-cell conductance, observed in coupled but not uncoupled beta-cells, emerges as a collective phenomenon. An overall implication is that improving the ability to monitor $\beta$-cell signaling should offer means to better understand the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. </p>
